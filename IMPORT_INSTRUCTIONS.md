## Import Behavior

### Adding New Products
- Leave the `id` column empty
- The system will create a new product with all provided data
- A unique ID will be automatically assigned

### Updating Existing Products
- Include the product's `id` in the file
- The system will find the existing product and update its fields
- If the ID doesn't exist, it will create a new product instead

### Example:

```csv
id,vendor_name,product_name,wholesale_case_price,wholesale_unit_price,retail_unit_price,stock_level
,New Vendor,New Product,25.00,1.00,2.00,100
42,Existing Vendor,Updated Product,30.00,1.25,2.50,200
```

In this example:
- Row 1: Creates a **new** product (no id)
- Row 2: **Updates** product with id=42 (or creates new if id 42 doesn't exist)

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's:
- **Download the template** first to see the correct column structure
- **Test with a small file** (2-3 products) before importing hundreds
- **Include IDs** when updating existing products
- **Use consistent formatting** for prices (e.g., 24.99, not $24.99)
- **Validate data** before import to avoid errors

### ‚ùå Don'ts:
- Don't include extra columns not in the template
- Don't use special characters in column headers
- Don't leave required fields empty
- Don't use currency symbols ($) or thousands separators (,) in prices
- Don't import the same file multiple times (it will create duplicates)

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Missing required fields"
**Solution**: Ensure every row has `product_name` and `vendor_name` filled in

### Error: "Invalid file type"
**Solution**: Use only .csv, .xlsx, or .xls files

### Error: "No data found in the file"
**Solution**: Make sure your file has data rows (not just headers)

### Error: "Failed to parse file"
**Solution**:
- Check that your CSV is properly formatted
- Ensure Excel file isn't corrupted
- Try saving Excel as CSV and import the CSV instead
